## Spotify Moody Player

Moody player will change the background color and theme to match the mood of the song you're playing, it takes all your Spotify playlists and lets you play a 30 second preview, the changes are made based on the energy and valence of the song, info provided by the Spotify API. 

It's interesting how often the color matches the main color of the album cover.

Made with react and material-ui.
